## 1. Purpose and Scope

**Purpose.** S.M.A.R.T. Hawk Supplier Prequalification onboards, evaluates, scores, and maintains the **Qualified Supplier List (QSL)** before any supplier can participate in audits, batches, or marketplace listings. It is the gatekeeper module — nothing flows downstream from an unqualified supplier.

**In scope:**
- Supplier nomination + initiation
- Structured data collection (regulatory certifications, manufacturing scope, financial/legal, ESG, sites + products)
- Desk review + (optional) on-site verification
- Risk-weighted scoring (geography + cert + history + product class)
- E-sig approval gate to QUALIFIED status
- Periodic requalification (annual default; configurable)
- Disqualification + reactivation flows
- Supplier-product + supplier-site association

**Out of scope (handed off):**
- Supplier audits (post-qualification) → Audit Management module
- Supplier marketplace listings → Marketplace module
- CAPA execution for supplier issues → CAPA module
- Procurement / PO workflow → not in S.M.A.R.T. Hawk scope (read-only via ERP integration future)
- Quality agreement document storage → Document Control (HawkVault)

## 2. Stakeholders and Personas

| Persona | Role | Goals | Pain without module |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Procurement Officer** (e.g., Karan Mehta) | Nominates new supplier; needs them qualified to issue PO | Fast turnaround; visibility into qualification status | Email chains; "where is this stuck?" |
| **QA Prequalification Specialist** (e.g., Anita Desai) | Owns the prequal case; collects data; conducts desk review; recommends decision | Single workspace; templated data collection; consistent scoring | Spreadsheets per supplier; lost evidence |
| **Supplier QA Head** (provides info) (e.g., Asha Sharma) | Responds to prequalification questionnaire | Single inbox; structured submission; reuse across customers | Re-answers same questions for every buyer |
| **QA Approver / QA Head** (e.g., Dr Elena Vasquez) | Final e-sig approval to qualified status | Auditable decision record; risk-score transparency | "Why did we qualify them?" — no record |
| **Tenant Admin** | Configures questionnaire templates, scoring rubric, periodic-requal cadence | Per-tenant tuning | Vendor controls everything |

Weights configurable per tenant. | System | ICH Q7 §17.40 risk-based | MUST | ✅ `supplierScoreService` |
| URS-A-031 | System SHALL display sub-scores transparently (each factor contribution); no black-box. | System | UX trust | MUST | ✅ |
| URS-A-032 | Scoring tier SHALL map: 80-100 LOW risk (annual requal); 60-79 MEDIUM (semi-annual); 40-59 HIGH (quarterly); <40 BLOCK (cannot proceed to approval). | System | Internal policy + ICH Q7 risk-based | MUST | ✅ |

| URS-A-052 | Overdue requal SHALL flag the supplier as AT_RISK and (configurably) block new POs / audits / marketplace bookings. | System | ISO 9001 §8.4.2 | MUST | ✅ |
| URS-A-053 | Requalification SHALL reuse last submission as baseline; supplier only updates changed fields + recerts. | Supplier | UX accelerator | SHOULD | ✅ |

### A7. Disqualification + Reactivation

---

## 4. Part B — Differentiator Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Rationale | MoSCoW | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| URS-B-001 | **supplierIntelAgent** SHALL fuse public regulator data (FDA Establishment Registration + Inspections + Warning Letters; EMA EudraGMDP; WHO-PQ) into a supplier risk dossier — auto-augmenting the score. | Reduces buyer effort; no incumbent does FDA+EMA+WHO fusion | MUST | ✅ live (`supplierIntelAgent.js`) |
| URS-B-002 | **One-Pass Supplier Profile (cross-buyer)** — a supplier completes the PQQ once; updates propagate to all consenting buyer tenants. Reduces supplier burden by 70%. | Supplier-side liquidity moat | SHOULD | ⏳ Same-buyer reuse live; cross-buyer requires consent UI |
| URS-B-003 | **AI cert-expiry watchdog** SHALL extract expiration dates from uploaded certs (OCR + LLM) and remind both parties at 90/60/30/7 days. | Prevents lapses; small but high-value | SHOULD | ⚠️ OCR pipeline partial |
| URS-B-004 | **Predictive supplier risk** model SHALL forecast 12-month failure probability from history + public signals; flag pre-emptively. | Differentiator; not in incumbents | COULD | 🚫 Not built |
| URS-B-005 | **Tier-1 / Tier-N supplier map** SHALL visualize multi-tier supply chain dependencies (your supplier's suppliers) for ESG / conflict-minerals / single-source risk. | Strategic risk feature | COULD | 🚫 Not built |
| URS-B-006 | **Cross-tenant findings surfacing (with consent)** — surface "another buyer found CAPA-relevant issue X at this supplier in last 12 months" — anonymized. | Network effects | COULD | ⏳ Deferred (consent UI) |
| URS-B-007 | **Industry-agnostic** — same engine SHALL serve pharma (ICH Q7), med-device (ISO 13485 §7.4.1), food (FSSC 22000 supplier control), auto (IATF 16949 §8.4) via configurable PQQ templates. | One platform, many verticals | MUST | ✅ template-driven |

---

## 5. Out-of-Scope

- **Supplier audits** → Audit Management module (qualified supplier becomes eligible for audit workflow)
- **Marketplace listings** → Marketplace module (qualified supplier becomes listable)
- **CAPA for supplier issues** → CAPA module (link from supplier record to CAPA)
- **Procurement / PO workflow** → external ERP (read-only ingestion future)
- **Quality agreement document signing** → Document Control workflow (supplier-prequal references the QA agreement docId)

---

## 6. Assumptions and Dependencies

- Multi-tenant: every Supplier scoped to `tenantOrgId` (the buyer); a supplier entity may exist across multiple buyer tenants
- Storage: certifications + supporting docs in HawkVault
- E-sig: password-based via shared `ElectronicSignature`
- Notification: email primary; in-app dashboard secondary
- AskHawk: groundedGen pipeline available for `supplierIntelAgent`
- Public-data sources: FDA, EMA, WHO-PQ APIs (rate-limited; cached)

---

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

| URS range | Verification |
|---|---|
| A1–A2 (lifecycle + data collection) | E2E `frontend/e2e/supplier-prequal.spec.ts` |
| A3 (desk review / on-site trigger) | Unit test on `siteVisitTriggerService`; integration with Audit module |
| A4 (scoring) | Unit test on `supplierScoreService` with canned input matrix |
| A5 (approval e-sig) | Backend test on signature ceremony |
| A6 (periodic requal) | Cron-trigger test + notification assertion |
| A7 (disqualification) | E2E asserting downstream block (audit + marketplace) |
| A8 (site/product linkage) | DB integrity test |
| B1 (supplierIntelAgent) | AI eval suite (recall on known regulatory actions) |
| B2 (cross-buyer reuse) | Consent flow E2E (TBD) |

---

## 8. Open Questions

1. **Cross-buyer reuse consent UI** (URS-B-002, URS-B-006) — supplier-side opt-in granularity (per-buyer? per-field? blanket?)
2. **Predictive risk model** (URS-B-004) — feature signals + training-data availability at our scale
3. **Tier-N map** (URS-B-005) — data sourcing strategy (self-reported vs public datasets)
4. **Score weights default** — current defaults are platform-set; should we ship vertical-pack presets (pharma vs med-device vs food)?
5. **Hard-block tier (<40)** — should it block approval or just warn? Current = hard block.
6. **Certificate OCR accuracy** (URS-B-003) — what's the acceptable false-negative rate before customer trust erodes?
7. **Disqualification appeals process** — UI for supplier to dispute? Today none.
